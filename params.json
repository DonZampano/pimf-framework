{"name":"PIMF","tagline":"Micro framework for PHP that emphasises minimalism and simplicity","body":"## Welcome to PIMF\r\nHave you ever wished a PHP framework that perfectly adapts to your projects needs, your programming experience and your customers budget? A thin PHP framewrok with less implementing rools and easy to learn how to use it? PIMF is about to satisfy your demands!\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gjerokrsteski/pimf.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gjerokrsteski/pimf)\r\n\r\n## PIMF principles\r\nA good and robust business-logic is better that fat and complex framework. Most of the PHP framewroks are bigger than your problem. At all you need less than 20% of the functionality of the framework to solve you problem. Therefore we belive that the “right” 20% of the effort is the 80% of the results - and that is PIMF.\r\n\r\n## Behind PIMF\r\nActually we created PIMF for personal use. The aim was to create robust and secure projects and deliver them fast. We wanted just one easy framewrok, who can be used once for all  our projects. And than - PIMF was born!\r\n\r\nPIMFs implementation is based on well proved design patterns as well as fast objects relation mapping mechanism - like famous PHP frameworks had. The architecture is designed upgrade friendly - so you can upgrade to newer versions without to override your projects. And for all of you out there, who like to create rich application interfaces with ExtJs or Dojo - we have created mechanism to couple your GUI to the controllers in a easy and fast way.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n**Step 1.** Download PIMF\r\n\r\n```php\r\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/gjerokrsteski/pimf.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 2.** Extract the PIMF archive and upload the contents to your web server.\r\n\r\n**Step 3.** Open the config.php file and set\r\n\r\n```php\r\n'environment' => 'production'\r\n'local_temp_directory' => '/tmp/' //if necessary\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 4.** Go to your PIMF root directory and run the command:  \r\n\r\n```cli\r\nphp pimf core:init\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 5.** Navigate to your application in a web browser.\r\n\r\nIf all is well, you should see a pretty PIMF splash page.
